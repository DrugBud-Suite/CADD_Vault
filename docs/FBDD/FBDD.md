# Fragment-based Drug Design

## Tools

- [MolOptimizer](https://github.com/csbarak/MolOpt_Students_2023): MolOptimizer is a Flask-based package useful for the optimization of fragment screening datasets, developed to assist researchers in the field of small fragment-based inhibitors by enabling the alignment of large ligand datasets, extracting chemical descriptors, and training machine learning models to predict binding scores.
- [DeepFrag](http://durrantlab.com/deepfragmodel):
- [CombiChem](https://github.com/karanicolaslab/combichem): CombiChem is a virtual screening approach that uses fragment screening techniques to identify and concatenate the best fragments into lead-like compounds, aiming to reduce computational resources while performing a comprehensive screen.
- [Fragmentstein](https://github.com/matteoferla/Fragmenstein): Fragmenstein performs merging, linking, and placing compounds by stitching bound compounds together like a reanimated corpse, operating as a 'placement' tool rather than traditional docking, and further energy minimizes the compounds within the protein environment.
- [Fragment-hit-followup](https://github.com/matteoferla/Fragment-hit-follow-up-chemistry): This repository contains a collection of notebooks and scripts for elaborating fragment hits identified crystallographically in the hit discovery stage of drug discovery, focusing on small fragments and including specific scripts for Diamond Light Source XChem targets.
- [CREM](https://github.com/DrrDom/crem): generate chemical structures using a fragment-based approach
  - [Software tools for fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD)](https://github.com/PatWalters/fragment_expansion/blob/master/fragment_expansion.ipynb)
- [FBDD_suite](https://github.com/KeenThera/FBDD_suite): A collection of computational tools for fragment based drug design, including fragment selection, fragment docking, fragment growing, linking, merging etc.

## Linker Design
- [DiffLinker](https://github.com/igashov/DiffLinker): An Equivariant 3D-conditional Diffusion Model for Molecular Linker Design that places missing atoms between disconnected fragments in 3D, designing molecules that incorporate all initial fragments with potential applications in linker generation for drug discovery.
- [DeLinker](https://github.com/oxpig/DeLinker): Deep Generative Models for 3D Linker Design
