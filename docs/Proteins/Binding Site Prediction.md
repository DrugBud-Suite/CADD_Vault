## General

- [AF2BIND](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/af2bind/blob/main/af2bind.ipynb): AF2BIND utilizes AlphaFold2 for predicting protein-ligand binding sites.
- [DogSiteScorer](https://proteins.plus/): This proteins.plus platform offers DogSiteScorer for predicting and scoring protein-ligand binding sites.
- [FPocketWeb](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/fpocketweb-download/): FpocketWeb is a browser app for identifying pockets on protein surfaces where small-molecule ligands might bind, running calculations locally on the user's computer.
- [P2rank](https://github.com/rdk/p2rank): P2Rank is a machine learning-based tool for predicting ligand-binding sites from protein structures, capable of handling various structure formats including AlphaFold models.
- [PrankWeb](https://prankweb.cz/): Builds upon P2Rank for the prediction of ligand binding sites from protein structure, offered as a service by ELIXIR.
- [GrASP](https://github.com/tiwarylab/GrASP/tree/main): GrASP (Graph Attention Site Prediction) identifies druggable binding sites using graph neural networks with attention.
- [CavityPlus](https://github.com/PKUMDL2017/CavityPlus?tab=readme-ov-file): A web server for protein cavity detection with pharmacophore modeling, allosteric site identification, and covalent ligand binding ability prediction.
- [IF-SitePred](https://github.com/oxpig/binding-sites): IF-SitePred is a method for predicting ligand-binding sites on protein structures. It first generates an embedding for each residue of the protein using the ESM-IF1 model, then performs point cloud clustering to identify binding site centres.
- [SGPocket](https://github.com/KevinCrp/SGPocket): A Graph Convolutional Neural Network to predict protein binding site.

## **Allosteric Site Prediction**

- [PASSer](https://passer.smu.edu/): Designed for accurate allosteric site prediction, PASSer offers three machine learning models for quick and extensive allosteric analysis.
- [AlloReverse](http://www.allostery.net/AlloReverse/): AlloReverse predicts multi-scale allosteric regulation information based on reversed allosteric communication theory, aiding in drug design and biological mechanism understanding.
## **Fragment Site Prediction**

- [FTMap](https://ftmap.bu.edu/show_example.php?example=ace): FTMap maps unbound protein surfaces to identify druggable hot spots where small molecules may bind.
## **Metal-binding site**

- [PinMyMetal](https://github.com/hhz-lab/PinMyMetal.git): Specific details about PinMyMetal, presumably a tool for predicting metal-binding sites in proteins, were not provided in the data fetched.
## **From Molecular Dynamics simulations**

- [POVME2](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/povme2/): POVME2 identifies druggable protein pockets and their unique conformations within molecular dynamics simulations, facilitating the discovery of novel pharmacologically active molecules.
