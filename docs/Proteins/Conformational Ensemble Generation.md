- [AF2-Rave](https://github.com/tiwarylab/alphafold2rave): AF2-Rave combines AlphaFold2 with enhanced sampling to predict a range of conformations for a given protein sequence, aiming to generate Boltzmann-ranked conformations
- [SubPEx](http://durrantlab.com/subpex/)
- [AlphaFlow](https://github.com/bjing2016/alphaflow): AlphaFlow is a modified version of AlphaFold, fine-tuned with a flow matching objective, capable of generating protein conformational ensembles.
- [Str2Str](https://github.com/lujiarui/Str2Str): Str2Str is a score-based framework for zero-shot protein conformation sampling, drawing inspiration from traditional methods to sample conformations guided by a neural score network trained on the PDB database.
- [AF-cluster](https://github.com/HWaymentSteele/AF_Cluster): This method predicts multiple protein conformations using sequence clustering and AlphaFold2, aiming to capture the diversity of protein structures.
- PepFlow
- CFold
- [DANCE](https://github.com/PhyloSofS-Team/DANCE): DANCE is designed to process a set of input protein 3D structures provided in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format and output protein or protein family-specific conformational collections in CIF or PDB format.
