## ML / DL

- **[AF2-Rave](https://github.com/tiwarylab/alphafold2rave)**: AF2-Rave combines AlphaFold2 with enhanced sampling to predict a range of conformations for a given protein sequence, aiming to generate Boltzmann-ranked conformations
- **[AlphaFlow](https://github.com/bjing2016/alphaflow)**: AlphaFold Meets Flow Matching for Generating Protein Ensembles. (Note: There is a preprint challenging the claims in the AF-Cluster paper. You can read it **[here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.05.574434)**.)
- **[Str2Str](https://github.com/lujiarui/Str2Str)**: Str2Str is a score-based framework for zero-shot protein conformation sampling, drawing inspiration from traditional methods to sample conformations guided by a neural score network trained on the PDB database.
- **[AF-cluster](https://github.com/HWaymentSteele/AF_Cluster)**: This method predicts multiple protein conformations using sequence clustering and AlphaFold2, aiming to capture the diversity of protein structures.
