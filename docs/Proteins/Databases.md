## Databases

- **[PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/)**: The RCSB Protein Data Bank provides access to experimentally determined 3D structures from the PDB archive and computed structure models, offering tools for exploration, visualization, and analysis.
  - **[PDB-redo](https://pdb-redo.eu/)**: Offers optimized versions of PDB entries through an automated procedure that refines, rebuilds, and validates structural models, combining popular crystallographic software with specially developed tools.
  - **[PDBe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe)**
- **[EMDB](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/)**: Electron Microscopy Data Bank
## **Data Mining**

- **[PDBminer](https://github.com/ELELAB/PDBminer)**
- **[Lemon](https://github.com/chopralab/lemon)**: a framework for rapidly mining structural information from the Protein Data Bank (standalone)
