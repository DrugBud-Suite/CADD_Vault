## Databases

- [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/): The RCSB Protein Data Bank provides access to experimentally determined 3D structures from the PDB archive and computed structure models, offering tools for exploration, visualization, and analysis.
  - [Lemon](https://github.com/chopralab/lemon): A framework for rapidly mining structural information from the Protein Data Bank, designed to be fast and flexible for querying 3D features of structures.
  - [PDB-redo](https://pdb-redo.eu/): Offers optimized versions of PDB entries through an automated procedure that refines, rebuilds, and validates structural models, combining popular crystallographic software with specially developed tools.
