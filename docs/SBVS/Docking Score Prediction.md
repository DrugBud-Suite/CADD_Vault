# Docking score prediction (for VS acceleration)

- [**DeepDocking**](https://github.com/jamesgleave/Deep-Docking-NonAutomated) : Deep Docking (DD) is a deep learning tool developed to accelerate docking-based virtual screening, capable of screening large chemical libraries like ZINC15 over 50 times faster than conventional docking methods.
- [**ChemProp**](https://github.com/aamini/chemprop) : Implements message passing neural networks with Deep Evidential Regression for fast and scalable uncertainty quantification in neural molecular property prediction, enabling accelerated optimization and guided virtual screening.
- [**HASTEN**](https://github.com/TuomoKalliokoski/HASTEN) : HASTEN (Machine Learning Boosted Docking) facilitates machine learning-enhanced virtual screening workflows, compatible with chemprop for machine learning methods and Glide for docking, supporting easy integration of user-specified methods and docking programs.
