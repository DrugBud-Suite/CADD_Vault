- **Interaction Filtering**
	- **[LigGrep](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/liggrep/)**: LigGrep is a program for identifying docked poses that participate in specified receptor/ligand interactions, accepting a protein receptor file, docked-compound files, and user-specified filters as input.
	- **[BINANA](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/binana-download/)**: BINANA analyzes the geometries of predicted ligand poses to identify molecular interactions that contribute to binding, also featuring a web-browser application for visualizing these interactions.

- **Clustering**
	- **[ClusterX](https://github.com/ChenSikang/ClusterX)**: ClusterX is a deep clustering framework for learning molecular representations of protein-ligand complexes and accurately clustering ligands, designed to assist computational medicinal chemists in making visual decisions.
- **RMSD calculation**
	- **[pyDockRMSD](https://github.com/neudinger/pyDockRMSD)**: DockRMSD is an open-source program that identifies the minimum symmetry-corrected RMSD for docked poses without losing computational efficiency, useful for ligand molecules with complex structural symmetry.
