# Synthetic Accessbility

- [DFRscore](https://github.com/Hwoo-Kim/DFRscore): Introduces a deep learning-based scoring system for synthetic complexity, utilizing retrosynthetic analysis to evaluate the synthesizability of compounds for virtual screening purposes.

- [SAScore](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Contrib/SA_Score): The Synthetic Accessibility Score (SAScore) aims to assess the synthetic difficulty of chemical compounds.

- [SCscore](https://github.com/connorcoley/scscore): SCScore is a synthetic complexity score that assigns a value between 1 and 5 to a molecule, based on the premise that published reactions should exhibit an increase in synthetic complexity.
